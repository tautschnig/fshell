** Running and Extending Benchmark Suites **

A benchmark suite consists of a set of configurations; such a configuration
describes which source code to run on and which parameters and queries should be
passed to FShell.

- Adding a new benchmark suite:
  * Add a make variable FOO to benchmarks/Makefile that lists the configurations.
  * Create the corresponding configuration files in benchmarks/conf.
  * If necessary, add additional source code in benchmarks/code; source code
    should be given as an archive of original source code (foo.tar.gz or
    foo.tar.bz2). You may add a patch foo.patch, if necessary. In case you do
    add code, add the corresponding basename to the BENCHMARKS variable in
    code/Makefile to ensure proper cleanup.

- Running a benchmark suite:
  * Run make benchmark-FOO.suite in the top build directory or run make
    FOO.suite in the benchmarks/ directory. The former allows running vpath
    builds, such as those in build/audit or the like.

- Running a single benchmark, debugging:
  * Run make benchmark-foo.only, benchmark-foo.debug, or benchmark-foo.gdb,
    depending on which level of debugging you need.

The logs of all benchmark runs are left in benchmarks/logs/.
